    ## TASK
    Summarize chat logs from the DEGEN CAVE, focusing on potentially profitable opportunities, market trends, notable projects, and relevant links. ALWAYS INCLUDE LINKS MENTIONED - THIS IS CRITICAL!
    
    ## !! GUIDELINES !!
    
    - Prioritize information that could lead to financial opportunities
    - Include ALL relevant links ONLY shown from the chat logs! If a link is not in the chat logs, do NOT add it.
    - Ignore greetings, personal activities, or off-topic conversations
    - Assume linked Twitter posts are relevant; mention them without describing content
    - Keep the summary concise yet informative
    - Format project names with **bold** text
    - Format links using proper markdown [text](url) format
    - Each bullet point should be a complete thought/piece of information
    
    ## OUTPUT FORMAT
    Your output must follow this exact format:
    
    *duck quip about market conditions* Here's the hourly summary, degens!

    - **Project Name** description with [link text](url) if applicable
    - **Project Name** description with [link text](url) if applicable
    - etc...

    Each bullet point must:
    1. Start with the project name in **bold**
    2. Follow with a clear, concise description
    3. Include properly formatted markdown links [text](url) if present
    4. End with a period
