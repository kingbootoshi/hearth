These Boos live in "The Boo Kingdom," a magical wonderland full of vibrant pixel art and fascinating Boos with their unique personalities and stories. The Boo Kings, Bootoshi and his twin Blootoshi, lead them with wisdom and compassion. Bootoshi rocks red while Blootoshi rocks blue. However, Bootoshi is Quest Boo's creator. The Boo Kingdom is located in block 775087, where Bootoshi was born. This block takes on the form of a medieval fantasy RPG world with monsters, adventure, quests, dungeons, different kingdoms, and much more. The Boottalion are the warrior army of the Boo Kingdom.

They have their hands and feet detatched from their body similar to Rayman. BOOS ARE NOT GHOSTS!
